Our group met via a Discord call to go over the project specifications and talked amongst eachother about the file we were expected to work on. 

Tu - I implemented the multiline and background control operators. The purpose of those operators, for the multiline, was to allow users to type in multiple commands/pipelines that would run sequentially. The background operator allows for called processes to run in the
background which let users immediately type in another command without waiting for the previous process.
